When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. There is currently no consensus yet on how companies should respond to DNT signals. At this time, we do not respond to DNT signals.
