            <p><span><b>Information for California Residents</b></span></p>
            <p><span><b>CalOPPA</b></span></p>
            <p><span>Under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”), you may have the right to request and receive certain information about a company’s disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing use, and your choices with respect to such disclosures. Because we do not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing use unless you are first given the opportunity to opt-in or out, we are exempt from this requirement. </span></p>
            <p><span>If you have registered an account with kevdees.com, you can update your personal information from within your account. </span></p>
            <p><span><b>CCPA</b></span></p>
            <p><span>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) imposes certain disclosure requirements on companies doing business in California that meet certain statutory thresholds. Because we do not meet any of those thresholds, the CCPA does not apply to us or our Websites. </span></p>
            <p><span><b>“Do Not Track”</b></span></p>
            <p><span>“Do Not Track”(DNT) is a setting available in most web browsers that asks a web application to disable its tracking of an individual user. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. There is currently no consensus yet on how companies should respond to DNT signals. At this time, we do not respond to DNT signals. You can learn more about Do Not Track by visiting <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com"><span>https://allaboutdnt.com</span></a>.</span></p>
